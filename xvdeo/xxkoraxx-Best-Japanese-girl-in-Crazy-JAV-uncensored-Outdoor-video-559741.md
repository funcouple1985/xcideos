The prince replied:  John, get ahead; you shall not see me turn my back this present day, but I will at all times be among the foremost.  He then mentioned to Sir Walter Woodland, his banner-bearer,  Banner, advance, within the name of God and St. George.

And when the prince of Wales noticed, from the departure of the cardinal with out being ready to acquire any honorable terms, that a battle was inevitable, and that the king of France held each him and his army in great contempt, he thus addressed himself to them:  Now, my gallant fellows, what though we be a small body when compared to the army of our enemies; don t allow us to be cast down on that account, for victory does not at all times observe numbers, however the place the Almighty God pleases to bestow it.

When he was come into his presence, the prince bent down over him and embraced him, saying,  My lord James, I am bound to honor you very a lot, for by your valor this day you might have acquired glory and renown above us all, and your prowess has proved you the bravest knight.

The lord James Audley, attended by his four squires, had positioned himself, sword in hand, in front of this battalion much before the remaining, and was performing wonders. The king of France was in the midst of them, and in nice danger; for the French and Gascons had taken him from Sir Denys de Morbeque and were disputing who ought to have him, the stoutest bawling out,  It is I who have got him.   No, no,  replied the others,  we have him.  The king to escape his peril, said,  Gentlemen, gentlemen, I pray you conduct me and my son in a courteous manner to my cousin the prince; and don t make such a riot over my capture, for I am so great a lord that I could make all sufficiently rich.  These phrases, and others which fell from the king, appeased them just a little, however the disputes had been always beginning once more, and they did not move a step with out rioting.
