I assume that kind of factor pretty well dooms his political profession since the one politicians who step down after stuff like this are Democrats. You want to know human behaviour in order to understand how the scriptures modify that, so I would say to you the very last thing that is needed to review the consequences of scripture is the scripture itself.

Having lost in the state courts on a constitutional claim, you can t then attempt the federal courts again; you ve received to pick one. Not less than Europe is aware of higher, we can t even get secularism proper. If you try to act superior, your petty impotence is much more exposed.
